This is a systematic mapping study (they review a bunch of literature and summarize what has been done in this field, and how. 
They then identify possibilities of future related work.

They group the studies based on their text analysis technique: Search and information retrieval, NLP, clustering, classification,..

As the title indicates, all the studies are related to software architecture and text analysis techniques. They do not mention any study that does
NLP, IE, clustering or classification on SADs (but also don't mention that possibility as implications for future researchers).
